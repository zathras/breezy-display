Display application for the Breezy project

This directory contains a web page for the display app of the Breezy
project.  When it's more mature, I'll put a snapshot of the source here.

This snapshot repository was initially created to make a website for
the Breezy Display App, so I could put that website on the Google Play
store.  I don't know if it will ever make sense to distribute the app
publicly via the play store, but it might be, so I want to get it set
up.  I don't think I can just use a link to the Breezy project at
https://github.com/kukulo2011/OpenCovid_ventilator, because the Google
Play Store has a policy that says "We don't allow apps that lack 
reasonable sensitivity towards or capitalize on a natural disaster, 
atrocity, conflict, death, or other tragic event."  Obviously an app
that provides information about the operation of a ventilator isn't
doing that, but the path of least resistance is to scrub any mention
of COVID from the store listing.
